            <p>
                I come from the land of the ice and snow, and then moved to Los Angeles in 2007.
                After several years working in television production/post, I made the transition into advertising.
                I'm a fan of analytics, data, and tech.  However, I also enjoy art; painting, writing, and sketching.
                When I'm not at work, or studying, you can find me by the beach throwing frisbee, or riding my bike
                around Venice.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                When I moved to LA I had some money in my pocket, a few cases of books, clothing, a few pillows,
                and a mattress pad.  Now I have career, dear friends, an amazing girlfriend, and rescue dog, Lettux, to which
                I'm allergic.  Life couldn't be better.
